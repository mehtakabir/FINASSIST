Here’s where “univariate analysis” is covered in the course:

- Video 8: Machine Learning Development Life Cycle
  - Brief mention/definition around 11:17–11:21 (about 4 seconds total). Good for quick context within the lifecycle.

- Video 18: EDA using Univariate Analysis
  - Dedicated coverage with examples. Key moments:
    - 26:40–26:42
    - 29:42–29:44
    - 29:58–30:00
    - Tip: Open Video 18 and jump to around 26:40, then continue through the 30:00 mark for the focused walkthrough.

If you want the main teaching segment, go to Video 18; if you just want where it’s mentioned in context, check Video 8 at ~11:17–11:21.
