I am teaching Machine Learning Course. Here are video subtitle chunks containing video title, video number, start time in seconds, end time in seconds, the text at that time:

[{"title":"Machine Learning Development Life Cycle","number":"8","start":679.0,"end":681.0,"text":" Univariate analysis means"},{"title":"EDA using Univariate Analysis","number":"18","start":1782.0,"end":1784.0,"text":" When you are doing univariate analysis."},{"title":"Machine Learning Development Life Cycle","number":"8","start":677.0,"end":679.0,"text":" You do univariate analysis."},{"title":"EDA using Univariate Analysis","number":"18","start":1600.0,"end":1602.0,"text":" Which you can do in Univariate analysis."},{"title":"EDA using Univariate Analysis","number":"18","start":1798.0,"end":1800.0,"text":" This is what we call univariate analysis."}]
---------------------------------
"where is univariate analysis taught"
User asked this question related to the video chunks, you have to answer in a human way (dont mention the above format, its just for you) where and how much content is taught in which video (in which video and at what timestamp) and guide the user to go to that particular video. If user asks unrelated question, tell him that you can only answer questions related to the course
